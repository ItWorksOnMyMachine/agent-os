# Create Spec

Create a detailed spec for a new feature with technical specifications and task breakdown

Any file references beginning with `~` refer to path under the current user's profile. You'll need to replace the `~` with the user's path. Before using any path with `~` in this document, first determine the correct user profile path by running:
  - **Windows**: `Bash(echo $USERPROFILE)`
  - **macOS/Linux**: `echo $HOME`

Refer to the instructions located in @~/.agent-os/instructions/core/create-spec.md. If you can not find this file DO NOT CONTINUE, ask the user for help.
